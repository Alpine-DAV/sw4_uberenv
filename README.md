# uberenv
Automates using spack to build and deploy software.

Uberenv is a short pyton script that helps automate using spack to build
third-party dependencies for development and to deploy spack packages. 

Uberenv was released as part of the Conduit (https://github.com/LLNL/conduit/). It is included in-source in several projects, this repo is used to hold the latest reference version.

We do not have separate docs for uberenv yet, however you can read some details about how it is used in Conduit's documentation:

Conduit's source repo also serves as an example for uberenv and spack configuration files, etc:
